2. Bullet Point List of Future Features to Add Iteratively

Here’s the "backlog" of ideas you mentioned, stripped down to essentials:
Strategy Bank: Create a library of all available financial strategies with blank placeholder text.
AI Integration (Later): Use AI to customize and adapt the placeholder text per client.
Toggle System: Each strategy can be toggled on/off, inserting its text into the report.
Form Enhancements: Expand the form to capture both quantitative inputs (assets, income, etc.) and qualitative data (goals, preferences).
Report Formatting: Generate professional, well-structured reports (PDF or DOCX).
Client Profiles: Ability to save and load client information for recurring updates.
Data Persistence: Start with local storage, later expand to a database.
Projection Integration: Include financial projections (charts, tables, etc.).
Template Management: Multiple report templates selectable by the user.
Structured Report Template System
Reports follow the exact predefined sections and order you already use manually.
Output looks identical to your current professional reports.
Bank of Strategies
Preloaded strategy templates with standard wording.
Only a finite set of strategies (no free-text to keep it consistent).
Toggle-Based Strategy Selection
Input form includes toggles/checklists for selecting applicable strategies.
Toggled strategies are automatically inserted into the report in the right section.
Client Data Integration
Input form for quantitative and qualitative client data.
Report automatically merges relevant client data into the prewritten strategy text.
Instant Report Generation
One-click "Generate Report" produces a ready-to-use output.
Exportable in a professional format (Word, PDF).
No AI Phase (Initial)
Keep everything static and deterministic (exact templates, exact formatting).
Later iteration: AI layer for slight personalization/customization.
Confidentiality / Stealth Use
Output must be indistinguishable from manually written reports.
System must mirror existing language, tone, and formatting to avoid detection.
Scalability
Later ability to update strategy templates as rules, tax laws, or planning methods evolve.
Future: multiple templates or styles for different types of clients.

Phase 1 – Core Foundations

Manual Data Input Form
Fields designed to mimic your current process for capturing client info.
Include comment boxes for extra context.
Plain Text Report Output
Generated reports are structured into predefined sections.
Output mirrors your existing manual report style.
Strategy Templates (Static)
Import a master file of predefined strategy texts.
Report pulls strategies directly from this "database."
Toggle system: manually select which strategies to include in a report.
Phase 2 – Enhanced Functionality

Template Placeholders
Strategy texts include placeholders (e.g., [ClientName], [Age]).
Placeholders are auto-filled from the input form.
Editable Strategy Bank
Ability to update and manage strategies inside the app (instead of hard-coding).
Organize strategies by categories (e.g., Tax Planning, Retirement, Legacy).
Formatting Improvements
Report output structured with headings, bullet points, and clean separation of sections.
Option to copy, save, or export text.
Phase 3 – Professionalization

Export Options
Export reports to Word or PDF while keeping exact professional formatting.
Reports remain indistinguishable from manual versions.
Local-Only Mode
Ensure the entire app can run in-browser (no external servers) to protect confidentiality.
Client Profiles (Optional)
Save/load client info locally for repeat use.
Data stored securely in local storage or encrypted local database.
Phase 4 – Advanced (Future)

AI Layer
Customize/prettify text based on client context.
Automatically adjust tone, merge strategies, or shorten/expand explanations.
Rule-Based Suggestions
System recommends strategies based on client input (age, income, goals).
Planner can accept/reject suggestions manually.
Multiple Templates
Different report formats for different client types (e.g., retirees, business owners).
